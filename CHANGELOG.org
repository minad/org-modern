* org-modern-indent change history

~org-modern-indent~ was incorporated as an extension to ~org-modern~ in v2.0.  The prior change history for ~org-modern-indent~ is as follows, based on its release versions as a separate package:

- **v0.6**: Merged as an ~org-modern~ extension.
- **v0.5.1**: Small simplifications for block drawing.
- **v0.5**: Another complete rewrite which substantially improves
  performance and accuracy.  Now block detection uses ~org-element~
  and the block styling is implemented in
  ~before/after-change-functions~. Benefits include:
  1. Higher performance and more reliable fontification.
  2. Ability to detect and correctly treat _damaged_ blocks
     (header/footer line altered or removed) as well as _merged_ blocks.
  2. Caches all prefix strings for lower memory usage/GC churn.
  3. No more "runaway" formatting when partial blocks are created:
     only _real_ blocks (according to ~org-element~) are

  Note that v0.5 implements indented block styling using display
  properties on the indentation text, so navigation will "skip over"
  it.
- **v0.1**: features a complete re-write to use font-lock directly.  This
  has a few benefits:
  1. No longer relies on org-mode face names for recognizing
     blocks, so ~org-src-block-faces~ can have arbitrary faces
     applied, e.g. for different ~src~ languages, as in the screenshot.
  2. Eliminates the "race" between font-locking and applying the prefix text properties.
  3. Enables in-text bracket decorations for "bulk-indented" blocks, for example blocks situated
     in an arbitrarily-nested plain list item.
