Thank you for reporting a bug.

Please use the latest stable release of Emacs 30.1 and start with `emacs -Q` or
`package-isolate` in order to only load a minimal set of packages. This way your
Emacs configuration is not loaded.

Make sure that you install the newest versions of the involved packages. Please
also reinstall and recompile the involved packages, ideally remove all and
reinstall all packages, to exclude compilation issues due to outdated
dependencies.

Please provide precise information, stack traces and the exact steps to
reproduce the issue. This is important to ensure that your problem can be
reproduced on a different machine.

If you are not really sure if your issue is a bug, please open a discussion
instead.
