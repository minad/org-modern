* Introduction

This package implements a modern style for your Org buffers using font locking
and text properties. The package styles headlines, keywords, tables and source
blocks. The styling is configurable, you can disable or modify the style of each
syntax element individually via the =org-modern= customization group.

[[https://github.com/minad/org-modern/blob/screenshots/example.gif?raw=true]]

The screenshots shows [[file:example.org][example.org]] with =org-modern-mode= turned on and off. The
elegant theme featured in the screenshot is [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes][modus-operandi]].

Since this package adjusts text styling, it depends on your font settings. You
should ensure that your =variable-pitch= and =fixed-pitch= fonts combine
harmonically and have approximately the same height. As default font, I
recommend variants of the [[https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka][Iosevka]] font, e.g., Iosevka Term Curly.
=org-modern-mode= tries to adjust the tag label display based on the value of
=line-spacing=. This looks best if =line-spacing= has a value between 0.1 and 0.4 in
the Org buffer. Larger values of =line-spacing= are not recommended, since Emacs
does not center the text vertically (see Emacs [[https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=76390][bug#76390]]).

* Configuration

The package is available on GNU ELPA and MELPA. You can install the package with
=package-install=. Then =org-modern= can be enabled manually in an Org buffer by
invoking =M-x org-modern-mode=. In order to enable =org-modern= for all your Org
buffers, add =org-modern-mode= to the Org mode hooks.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Option 1: Per buffer
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'org-modern-mode)
(add-hook 'org-agenda-finalize-hook #'org-modern-agenda)

;; Option 2: Globally
(with-eval-after-load 'org (global-org-modern-mode))
#+end_src

Try the following more extensive setup in =emacs -Q= to reproduce the looks of the
screenshot above after the installation of =org-modern=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Minimal UI
(package-initialize)
(menu-bar-mode -1)
(tool-bar-mode -1)
(scroll-bar-mode -1)
(modus-themes-load-operandi)

;; Choose some fonts
;; (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Iosevka")
;; (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :family "Iosevka Aile")
;; (set-face-attribute 'org-modern-symbol nil :family "Iosevka")

;; Add frame borders and window dividers
(modify-all-frames-parameters
 '((right-divider-width . 40)
   (internal-border-width . 40)))
(dolist (face '(window-divider
                window-divider-first-pixel
                window-divider-last-pixel))
  (face-spec-reset-face face)
  (set-face-foreground face (face-attribute 'default :background)))
(set-face-background 'fringe (face-attribute 'default :background))

(setq
 ;; Edit settings
 org-auto-align-tags nil
 org-tags-column 0
 org-catch-invisible-edits 'show-and-error
 org-special-ctrl-a/e t
 org-insert-heading-respect-content t

 ;; Org styling, hide markup etc.
 org-hide-emphasis-markers t
 org-pretty-entities t
 org-agenda-tags-column 0
 org-ellipsis "…")

(global-org-modern-mode)
#+end_src

An alternative setup, using ~use-package~ and modifying some of the display entities:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-modern
    :custom
    (org-modern-block-indent t)  ; to enable org-modern-indent when org-indent is active
    (org-modern-hide-stars nil)
    (org-modern-todo-faces
     '(("STARTED" :foreground "yellow")
       ("CANCELED" org-special-keyword :inverse-video t :weight bold)))
    (org-modern-list
     '((?* . "•")
       (?+ . "‣")))
    (org-modern-fold-stars
     '(("▶" . "▼")
       ("▷" . "▽")
       ("▸" . "▾")
       ("▹" . "▿")))
    (org-modern-checkbox
     '((?X . "✔")
       (?- . "┅")
       (?\s . " ")))
    (org-modern-label-border 1)
    :hook
    (org-mode . org-modern-mode)
    (org-agenda-finalize . org-modern-agenda))
#+end_src


* Block indentation

Since version 2.0, this package also incorporates ~org-modern-indent~, which
provides block bracket styling when ~org-indent-mode~ is enabled, including
support for "bulk-indented" blocks nested within plain lists:

[[https://github.com/minad/org-modern/blob/screenshots/indent.png?raw=true]]

~org-modern-indent~ is disabled by ~org-modern~ by default. Configure
~org-modern-block-indent=t~ to enable. To activate ~org-indent-mode~ in all org
files, set ~org-startup-indented=t~.

*Note*: Currently =org-modern-indent= requires zero ~line-spacing~, as it leads to
gaps in the vertical bars drawn to indicate blocks, but hopefully this can be
improved in the future.

** Bulk-indented blocks (e.g. within plain lists):

Bulk-indented blocks have "real" (space/tab) indentation applied and managed by
org. This extra indentation is applied by org on _top_ of the (fake, prefix-based)
indentation used by org-indent. To nest blocks properly within such indented
content, e.g. in plain list items, you only have to begin the ~#+begin~ at the
same level as the list element's text.

As an important principle, ~org-modern-indent~ does not alter the contents of the
text in your org documents, not even indentation. It just styles what is there.
To help achieve proper block bulk-indented alignment, here are a few ways to
alter blocks indentation using org and other commands:

- *Start things right*: Hit return after your last line of text (e.g in a list
  item), then immediately hit =C-c C,= to create the desired block. It will be
  indented at the right level:

  #+begin_src org
     - This list item contains a:
       - sublist, which holds a block:
         [C-c C-,] here
  #+end_src

- *Move flush left*: Note: =M-{= will get you to the start of a block quickly. =M-\=
  at block start will move the block's first header line to column 0. Then
  =M-S-left= (or =right=) will indent the full block.
- *Indent rigidly*: =M-h= selects the entire block. Then =C-x TAB= enters "rigid
  indent" mode, after which left/right moves the entire block.
- *Re-indent a block*: If you have a block that is partially aligned, perhaps with
  a "hanging end", like so:

  #+begin_src org

   - List 1
       - List 2
         ,#+begin_src lang
            foo_lang(x)
         ,#+end_src
  #+end_src

  you can simply use =M-S-left/right= at block start (or in fact anywhere on the
  block header/footer) to ~org-indent-block~. Note that
  ~org-src-preserve-indentation=nil~ is an important setting, to allow org to
  (re-)indent blocks to respect the local indentation inside list and other
  elements. Also note that (from ~org-indent-region~):

  #+begin_quote
  The function will not indent contents of example blocks, verse blocks and
  export blocks as leading white spaces are assumed to be significant there.
  #+end_quote

** Font spacing and faces

The default ~fixed-pitch~ font (from which ~org-meta-line~ inherits) has line
spacing >1.0 on some systems. This will introduce gaps _even if your default font
is changed_, and ~line-space~ is nil. To correct it, add:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :family "Hack" :height 1.0) ; or whatever font family
#+end_src

*** The bracket style

If you'd like a different face than ~org-meta-line~ for the "bracket", configure
the ~org-modern-indent-bracket-line~ face.

* Incompatibilities

- =org-num-mode= interferes with the =org-modern= prettification of TODO keywords.
- =visual-wrap-prefix-mode= relies on the =wrap-prefix= text property which is also
  used by =org-modern=.
- =org-modern-indent-mode= is incompatible with non-zero =line-spacing=.

* Alternatives

The tag style of =org-modern= is inspired by Nicholas Rougier's [[https://github.com/rougier/svg-tag-mode][svg-tag-mode]]. In
contrast to =svg-tag-mode=, the package =org-modern= avoids images and uses more
efficient Emacs box text properties. By only styling the text via text
properties, the styled text, e.g., dates or tags stay editable and are easy to
interact with.

The approach used here restricts the flexibility (e.g., no rounded corners) and
creates dependence on the size and alignment of the font. Combining
=org-modern-mode= with =svg-tag-mode= is possible. You can use SVG tags and use the
table and block styling from =org-modern=. If you are interested in further
tweaks, Emacs comes with the builtin =prettify-symbols-mode= which can be used for
individual styling of custom keywords.

Alternatives are the older [[https://github.com/integral-dw/org-superstar-mode][org-superstar]] and [[https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets][org-bullets]] packages, which are
more limited and mainly adjust headlines and lists. =org-superstar= relies on
character composition, while =org-modern= uses text properties, which are
considered more future-proof. Note that =org-modern= is a full replacement for
both =org-superstar= and =org-bullets=. You can disable styling of certain elements,
e.g., =org-modern-timestamp=, if you only want to use the subset of =org-modern=
equivalent to =org-superstar=.
