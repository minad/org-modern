This package implements a "modern" style for your Org buffers using font locking
and display properties. The package styles headlines, keywords, tables and
source blocks. The styling is configurable, you can enable, disable or modify
the style of each syntax element individually. Take a look at the =org-modern=
customization group.

This package is still early in its development, so expect bugs and issues in
particular due to unfortunate interactions of the =variable-pitch= and =fixed-pitch=
fonts. Bug reports, improvement or style proposals are welcome! Maybe some more
Org elements deserve styling or alternative stylings should be offered?

The tag style of =org-modern= is a poor Emacsien's ripoff from Nicholas Rougier's
beautiful [[https://github.com/rougier/svg-tag-mode][svg-tag-mode]]. In contrast to =svg-tag-mode=, this package avoids images
and uses cheap and fast Emacs box display properties. Unfortunately this
significantly restricts the flexibility in styling and may lead to
font-dependent issues. We do our best, but for example there is no way we can
round corners. Of course a combination of =org-modern= with =svg-tag-mode= is
possible. You can use SVG tags and use the table and block styling from
=org-modern=. If you are interested in further tweaks, Emacs comes with the
builtin =prettify-symbols-mode= which can be used for individual styling of custom
keywords.

Another very popular alternative is [[https://github.com/integral-dw/org-superstar-mode][org-superstar]], which has a more restricted
feature set and mainly adjusts headlines and lists. =org-superstar= relies on
character composition, while =org-modern= uses display properties, which are
considered more future-proof.

This is a screenshot of [[file:example.org][example.org]] with =org-modern= turned on and off. The theme

The package is not yet available in a package repository, so it must be
installed manually from this repository via =package-install-file=. Then
=org-modern= can be enabled manually by invoking =M-x org-modern-mode=. In order to
enable =org-modern= for all your Org buffers, add =org-modern-mode= to the Org hook
list.
